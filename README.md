# Trinomial Split

-- This will (eventually) be a set of python  classes and functions that takes a Smithsonian Trinomial Number (STN), splits it into its constituent parts, and performs a lookup to see what state and county it is referring to. 

-- A small test program will also be written to test out the functions.

-- This project was started mostly because I wanted a venue in which I could learn Python.
